# Write a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns a list
# with all the words that are five letters long in that text. For example,
# assume you have a string with the following text:

# "This is a text file with some words I wrote. One thing is certain: this prose will not win any literary prizes."
# Your function should return the list:

# ['words', 'wrote', 'thing', 'prose']
# Remember the punctuation marks!
text = "This is a text file with some words I wrote. One thing is certain: this prose will not win any literary prizes."
